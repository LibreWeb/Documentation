Dicussions and help can be found on our Forums, Telegram or Matrix. Other services we do not trust and/or proven themselves enough to be used as the LibreWeb communication.

<!-- ## LibreWeb Forums -->

## Instant chat

### Matrix

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is a decentralized, open standard and federated communication protocol. You can use the web version, or install the Matrix clients (called Element) on your computer as well. Or even host your own Matrix server (Synapse) and become part of the federation. Both of which are open-sourced. Messages can be end-to-end encrypted if desired.

[Join the public Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#libreweb:melroy.org?via=melroy.org).

### Telegram

Telegram is a cross-platform messaging service, clients are open-source (server is proprietary). Also messages are not encrypted by default, secret chats are encrypted.
