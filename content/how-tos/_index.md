No matter what you are looking for, we have a tutorial and how-tos to help you.

## Getting started - Installing LibreWeb Browser

Visit the [releases page](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/releases). Download the correct package for your Linux distribution.

## How to deploy my site/blog?

LibreWeb is using markdown files as source instead of HTML.

You should be future-proof for LibreWeb if you currently use static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll to generate your site.

LibreWeb has a built-in markdown editor that allows you to easily write your own site without the need for technical skills. Moreover, LibreWeb will soon have additional features that will allow you to deploy fully functional sites and rich content on IPFS - like you can with Hugo and Jekyll - *without* the need to know or write any HTML.

## How to contribute to LibreWeb Documentation?

In order to contribute to LibreWeb Docs (this site), you should be have some basic knowledge about:

1. Git - See "Related files" below
2. Markdown syntax - [Take a look at the markdown basics](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

After this, you should be able to edit a page (notice the: "<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Edit this page" link in the right-top corner).  
Fork the git project in GitLab. Edit directly in GitLab. *Or* add your SSH public key to your GitLab profile and `git clone` the fork project locally on your computer.

After this you should be able to `git commit -am "Update file"` and  `git push` your changes. Followed by [creating a Merge Request](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/merge_requests) in GitLab.

I attached a well written book about Git. As well as a handy Git cheat sheet, which you can download below:
