---

No matter what you are looking for, we have a tutorial and how-tos to help you.

## Getting started

How to install LibreWeb Browser? Just visit the [releases page](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/releases). And download the correct package for your Linux distribution.

## How to deploy my site/blog?

LibreWeb is actually using markdown files as the source instead of HTML.

If you are using static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll to generate your site currently, you should be future proof for LibreWeb.

Moreover, LibreWeb has a built-in markdown editor to easily write our own site with no technical skills required. Additional features will be added later for deploying the content on IPFS as well as fully functional sites, simular to Hugo/Jekyll. *Without* any need to generate HTML content.

## How to contribute to LibreWeb Documentation?

In order to contribute to LibreWeb Docs (this site), you should be have some basic knowledge about:

1. Git - See "Related files" below
2. Markdown syntax - [Take a look at the markdown basics](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

After this, you should be able to edit a page (notice the: "<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Edit this page" link in the right-top corner).  
Fork the git project in GitLab. Edit directly in GitLab. *Or* add your SSH public key to your GitLab profile and `git clone` the fork project locally on your computer.

After this you should be able to `git commit -am "Update file"` and  `git push` your changes. Followed by [creating a Merge Request](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/merge_requests) in GitLab.

I attached a well written book about Git. As well as a handy Git cheat sheet, which you can download below:
