Here you will find the frequently asked questions.

## What is the current state of the LibreWeb project?

We already executed several proof-of-concepts and research topics part of the [LibreWeb Research Lab](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/research_lab).

Currently, the [LibreWeb Browser project](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser) is still in heavy development (Alpha phase).  

### Download

LibreWeb releases can be found on the [Releases page](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/releases) (currently GNU/Linux builds, but soon Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows). I would say, try it out, and give feedback on the (missing) features you like to see implemented first (or contribute yourself).

## How can I contribute?

We are always welcoming new contributors to your project! Thank you for considering helping our project with the goal to create a better Internet.

You can help the LibreWeb Project in several ways, including but not limited to:

* [Browser Development](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser)
* [Updating Documentation](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/docs-website)
* [Issue/feature reporting](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/issues)

Read also the [Contribute to LibreWeb](/project/contribute) page.

## Is LibreWeb Free?

Yes, [LibreWeb Browser](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser) is fully open-source and is 100% **free software**, licensed under the [MIT license](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/blob/master/LICENSE). No costs, no ads, no tracking, no telemetry, no in-app purchases.

Also LibreWeb Browser is fully decentralized, allowing you to store your content across the network, without any hosting costs. And no censorship. LibreWeb uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for decentralized content fetching and storage.

Research projects, websites and documentation pages are also open-source available and open for merge requests.

## How can I deploy my site on LibreWeb?

LibreWeb is actually using markdown files as the source instead of HTML.

If you are using static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll to generate your site currently, you should be future proof for LibreWeb.

Moreover, LibreWeb has a built-in markdown editor to easily write our own site with no technical skills required. Additional features will be added later for deploying the content on IPFS as well as fully functional sites, simular to Hugo/Jekyll. *Without* any need to generate HTML content.

## Can LibreWeb Browser replace my current web-browser?

LibreWeb Browser is sololy intended for surfing and publishing content/sites on the **decentralized web**. Also for security reasons; you won't allow the LibreWeb to browse the 'current Internet'.

Once more content will be available on the decentralized web, there is less need for the current centralized web. However, the current world wide web as we know it won't disappear anytime soon to be fully honest. So it will take time for developers and users alike to convert to a decentralized world.
