## What is LibreWeb?

LibreWeb is a project which has several sub-projects, including the [LibreWeb Browser](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser).

LibreWeb Browser is a fully **decentralized** free software & open-source Web Browser. Allowing users to easily browse and host new content on the decentralized web.

Decentralization comes with many benefits like resilient to censorship and no single point of failure, please read the [Concepts](/concepts) for more info.

## What is the current state of the LibreWeb project?

We already executed several proof-of-concepts and research topics part of the [LibreWeb Research Lab](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/research_lab).

Currently, the [LibreWeb Browser project](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser) is still in heavy development (Alpha phase).  

### Download

LibreWeb releases can be found on the [Releases page](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/releases) (currently GNU/Linux builds, but soon Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows). I would say, try it out, and give feedback on the (missing) features you like to see implemented first (or contribute yourself).

## How can I contribute?

We are always welcoming new contributors to your project! Thank you for considering helping our project with the goal to create a better Internet.

You can help the LibreWeb Project in several ways, including but not limited to:

* [Browser Development](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser)
* [Updating Documentation](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/docs-website)
* [Issue/feature reporting](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/issues)

Read also the [Contribute to LibreWeb](/project/contribute) page.

## Is LibreWeb Free?

Yes, [LibreWeb Browser](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser) is fully open-source and is 100% **free software**, licensed under the [MIT license](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/blob/master/LICENSE). No costs, no ads, no tracking, no telemetry, no in-app purchases.

Also LibreWeb Browser is fully decentralized, allowing you to store your content across the network, without any hosting costs. And no censorship. LibreWeb uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for decentralized content fetching and storage.

Research projects, websites and documentation pages are also open-source available and open for merge requests.

## How can I deploy my page on LibreWeb?

For how-tos, please see the [How-to documentation page](/how-tos/#how-to-deploy-my-siteblog)

## People are unable to access my page/site?

Make sure the **UPnP** (Universal Plug and Play) feature is enabled on your router, then port forwarding should be correctly configured automatically.

Alternatively, you can always open TCP port `4001` manually in your router's firewall to your local IP address.

Read also [NAT configuration](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/nat-configuration/) on the official IPFS documentation page.

## Can LibreWeb Browser replace my current web-browser?

LibreWeb Browser is sololy intended for surfing and publishing page/sites on the **decentralized web**. For security reasons; LibreWeb Browser won't allow you to access the 'current Internet'.

Once more content will be available on the decentralized web, there is less need for the current centralized web as we know it.  
However, the current WWW won't disappear anytime soon to be fully honest. It will take time for both web-developers and users alike to convert to a decentralized world.
