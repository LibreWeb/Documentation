New to LibreWeb or the distributed web? Learn about the concepts.

## LibreWeb

LibreWeb (specifically LibreWeb Browser) is a decentralized open-source browser. Allowing you to browse and host your content on the new decentralized web/Internet. Powered by [IPFS](#ipfs). 

Decentralization comes with many benefits, including but not limited:

* **No censorship**. Because the data is stored in a decentralized manner across the world, governments are unable to block or censor the content.
* **No single-point-of-failure.** If a specific server/node is down, your data can be served by other nodes within the network.
* **Fast**. The nearest node can serve you the content, basically acting as a content delivery network (CDN), however then decentralized.

### Markdown Syntax

LibreWeb is using [Markdown syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as the 'source-code' of your content/article/site/blog, similar to static-website generators like `Hugo` or `Jekyll`, however LibreWeb Browser does **not** need the conversion step from Markdown to HTML. 

LibreWeb Browser parsers & renders the Markdown documents directly, allowing to view the content by the end-user. Without HTML and JavaScript, the websites are much cleaner and faster to load.  
A real content-first approach, allowing the user to change their look & feel of the content, just like with e-books.

### Blockchain

LibreWeb is explicitly **NOT** using any Blockchain technology or based on a cryptocurrency. Because blockchain solutions can give huge scalability issues as well as an unnecessary bad influence on our climate. 

Most importantly, there is no need to use this technology in order to create a decentralized Internet.

## IPFS

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.

Making it possible to download a file from many locations that aren't managed by one organization:

* **Supports a resilient internet.** If someone attacks Wikipedia's web servers or an engineer at Wikipedia makes a big mistake that causes their servers to catch fire, you can still get the same webpages from somewhere else.
* **Makes it harder to censor content.** Because files on IPFS can come from many places, it's harder for anyone (whether they're states, corporations, or someone else) to block things. We hope IPFS can help provide ways to circumvent actions like these when they happen.
* **Can speed up the web when you're far away or disconnected.** If you can retrieve a file from someone nearby instead of hundreds or thousands of miles away, you can often get it faster. This is especially valuable if your community is networked locally but doesn't have a good connection to the wider internet.
