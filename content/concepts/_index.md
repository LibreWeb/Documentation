## LibreWeb

## IPFS

IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.

Making it possible to download a file from many locations that aren't managed by one organization:

* **Supports a resilient internet.** If someone attacks Wikipedia's web servers or an engineer at Wikipedia makes a big mistake that causes their servers to catch fire, you can still get the same webpages from somewhere else.
* **Makes it harder to censor content.** Because files on IPFS can come from many places, it's harder for anyone (whether they're states, corporations, or someone else) to block things. We hope IPFS can help provide ways to circumvent actions like these when they happen.
* **Can speed up the web when you're far away or disconnected.** If you can retrieve a file from someone nearby instead of hundreds or thousands of miles away, you can often get it faster. This is especially valuable if your community is networked locally but doesn't have a good connection to the wider internet.
