How did the **LibreWeb project** started? And how will the future look like?

## History of LibreWeb

<!--## Roadmap

Coming soon  Part of GitLab?

## Source code

Our source code is hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb), which has multiple projects. The main project is the [LibreWeb Browser repository](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser).

## Success criteria

The following success criteria has been identified from the beginning:

* **Decentralized:** No single-point of failure or censorship by governments. Data is stored redundantly, no client-server anymore;
* **Easy:** Everyone should be able to browse the decentralized web and create their own site/blog/news page and publish the content via an built-in editor (no technical knowledge required);
* **Encrypted network:** Sensitive data should be encrypted by default (eg. AES 4096-bit RSA private/public key-pair);
* **Versioning:** Revisions of content documentions, never have broken links;
* **Fully featured sites:** Publisher should be able to add multiple pages as well as add additional meta data (like title, desc, weight). Similar to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static-site generators;
* **Human-readable source code:** Use Markdown as source-code which is easy to understand and type. Markdown can also be extended with additional features;
* **Visitor is in control:** The visitors are in control, they can individually change their look & feel or style of the content (just like with e-books);
* **Content is King:** Content-first approach, no flashy ad banners, web animations or JavaScript pop-ups anymore;
* **Fast & Extensible:** LibreWeb Browser should be fast and easily extensible.

## Research

LibreWeb has a dedicated [Research project in GitLab](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/research_lab). This is a place for experiments, research and prototypes. We make dediciations based on facts, before rolling-out new ideas.

## Related projects

LibreWeb is using the [IPFS stack](https://ipfs.io/) to accelerate the decentralized movement.
