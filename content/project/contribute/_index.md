We always welcome new supporters and contributors to LibreWeb!

Here is a quick listing of things we need help with and how you can get started.

## Code

For code contribution visit the [LibreWeb Browser repository](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser) on GitLab. You'll need an account in order to contribute.

Once you have an account, you will be to [fork the GitLab LibreWeb Browser](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/forks/new) project and `git clone`  the project on your computer. As well as creating a new [Merge Request](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/merge_requests) in GitLab of your changes.

Depending on your change, some knowledge of C++, GTK or IPFS is required.

## Documentation

You are reading the documentation page currently, the content source of every page can be found the [LibreWeb Docs project](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/docs-website/-/tree/master/content) on GitLab.

You can [create an issue](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/docs-website/-/issues) in the Docs project. Or make your own proposals by clicking "<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Edit this page" link and create your own changes via a [Merge Request](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/docs-website/-/merge_requests) in GitLab.
