We always welcome new supporters and contributors to LibreWeb!

Here is a quick listing of things we need help with and how you can get started.

## Code

For code contribution check-out the [LibreWeb Browser repository](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser) on GitLab.

You are able to fork/clone the git archive yourself, and create merge requests.

## Documentation

You are reading the documentation page currently, every page can be edited.  
Notice the "<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Edit this page" in the right-top corner on each page, allowing you to easily edit the page.

You can create an [issue on the documentation repository](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/docs-website/-/issues) or create your own [merge requests](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/docs-website/-/merge_requests).

## Community

Interact with the community, people may get stuck or have questions.

See the [Telegram](https://t.me/libreweb) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#libreweb:melroy.org?via=melroy.org) rooms you can join and help out.
